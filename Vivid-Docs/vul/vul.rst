=============

**Welcome to Vivid Engine's Vivid Utility Library (VUL) documentation!**

VUL is, as its name implies, a utility library for Vivid Engine. It is heavily
used by the engine, but is not bound to it and can be used as a standalone
project.

VUL is C++20. It does **not** currently use concepts, but uses other features
from the latest standard.

VUL is **exception-safe** - it does not take or use exceptions. It can be safely
compiled with :code:`-fno-exceptions`, but if not, it will be transparent and let all
of the exceptions through.

Some of its most memorable features are: *COMING SOON*.
